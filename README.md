This is my study over the Collatz conjecture, the study aims to make a predictive model on the patterns of the "Collatz decomposition" (a concept that i introduce), using some of the classical tools of Machine learning.

Topics to be covered.
- Introduction to the Collatz conjecture using a simple proposed recurrence relation.
- Cluster analysis.
- SMOTE technique.
- Collatz model-transformer.
- Multi-modeling and assessment.
